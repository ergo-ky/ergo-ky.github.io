			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<h3>Ky is a multi-displinary artist based out of Omaha, Nebraska. Mixing traditional crafts such as carpentry,gardening, and painting with experimental technologies such as augmented reality and blockchain consensus. She seeks to thread a continuous loop through these complimentart mediums. <br>
			Drawing motivation from local popup community events, Hackathon discord servers, and the ever-seemingly evolving space. Ky began to question the role she was to play society, and how her art could reflect this contemplation. Taking a step back and really focusing on the core of what she wanted to do. Ky found that her journey as an artist was just beginning.<br>
			Some projects that she has started along the way so far have been: illustrations, animations, and prints.
